# O Pencil, My Old Friend
### Berlin (May 2015)

--

It’s been a while since you've travelled the empty streets of my notebook.

I assume you (like all humans) yearn to be held and appreciated.

You to realise life is short, even shorter if life is written too fast …

You are still simple and easy going and have pretty much remained solid over the years, kinda like the man I daily aspire to be. 

My wish is to roam with you more the paths of poetry, enjoy writing more, but not too much, just so that your life is not too short-lived.
