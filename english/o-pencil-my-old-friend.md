### O Pencil, My Old Friend

---

Itâ€™s been a while since you've travelled the empty streets of my notebook.

I assume you; like all humans; yearn to be held and appreciated.

You to realise life is short, even shorter if life is written too fast ...

You are still simple, easy going and have remained solid over all these years (like the type of man I aspire to be).

My wish is to visit more with you; the paths of poetry, weird characters of countries afar, the empty streets of funny short stories yet to be written ... but ... not too much though! 

We obviously don't want your life to be too short-lived.
