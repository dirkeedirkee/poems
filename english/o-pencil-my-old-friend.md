### O Pencil, My Old Friend

---

Itâ€™s been a while since you've travelled the empty streets of my notebook.

I assume you; like all humans; yearn to be held and appreciated.

You to realise life is short; even shorter if life is written too fast ...

You are still simple, easy going and have remained solid after all these years.

My wish is to still visit more with you; the paths of poetry, the hidden away villages of countries afar, funny short stories about characters who take time out of their day to laugh at themselves. 

But ... not too much though! We obviously don't want your life to be too short-lived.
