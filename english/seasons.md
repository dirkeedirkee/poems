### Seasons

---

Within some seasons we go swim naked in the pool next door<br />
Within other seasons we become aware we are not 18 anymore

Within some seasons we stay up all night till morning breaks<br />
Within other seasons we struggle to forgive ourselves for our own mistakes

Within some seasons there is non-stop hail and rain<br />
Within other seasons there are the most beautiful rainbows after the pain

Within some seasons the sun never stops shining<br />
Within other seasons we meet random friends and never stop dining

Within some seasons we see intricate falling snow<br />
Within other seasons we see thousands of colorful flowers grow

Within some seasons we need to think fast and draw each our own dots<br />
Within other seasons we finally understand the “why’s” only after we connect all the spots.
