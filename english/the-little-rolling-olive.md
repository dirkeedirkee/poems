### The little rolling olive

---

Once upon an autumn fall<br />
A little olive fell from a tree before the winter’s call

Like a little round ball it rolled and rolled down the hill<br />
Until, curious of the new scenes around him, he stood still<br />

(*)…………………………………………<br />
…………………………………………………<br />
…………………………………………………<br />

With a smile on its' face<br />
It chose to root itself and embrace<br />
A brand new beginning, for him and his olive-race!<br />
